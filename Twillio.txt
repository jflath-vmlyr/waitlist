So it does appear that we are hitting it, though I'm not seeing errors. 
To give you some clarification if we weren't able to reach your URL at all the inbound messages would see issue such as a notification in your debugger. 
If we weren't able to hit it at all then the messages wouldn't come inbound. 
I'd suggest reviewing your server logs for anything inbound as well as checking our documentation here; https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml/sms/twilio_request
